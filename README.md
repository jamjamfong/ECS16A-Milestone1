## Milestone 1 Contribution Breakdown 

**Jamie** - I completed the table.py file. I also facilitated a majority of the version control and Github setup. Lastly, I played a role in debugged our implementation to pass the tests. 

**Sabrina** - 46% Contribution: I completed the entire db.py and page.py file. I also debugged the table.py file specifically rewrote the _get_latest_column_value, get_version_column_value, and update_record functions. I also debugged the query.py file specifically the update, select_version, and sum functions. By debugging these functions it allowed our project to pass the Existing primary key results update, Verify updated versions (version 0), Aggregate tests on record versions, and Update records and version check. I also did version control.
