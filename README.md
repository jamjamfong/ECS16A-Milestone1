## Milestone 1 Contribution Breakdown 

**Jamie** - I completed the table.py file. I also facilitated a majority of the version control and Github setup. Lastly, I played a role in debugged our implementation to pass the tests. 

**Sabrina** - 46% Contribution: I completed the entire db.py and page.py file. I also debugged the table.py file specifically rewrote the _get_latest_column_value, get_version_column_value, and update_record functions. I also debugged the query.py file specifically the update, select_version, and sum functions. By debugging these functions it allowed our project to pass the Existing primary key results update, Verify updated versions (version 0), Aggregate tests on record versions, and Update records and version check. I also did version control.

**Egnegt** 15% I debugged and made sure m1_tester ran to pass all of the testswhile also making some changes to index.py(making the insert_key and remove_key). I also made some contributions to table.py, making the first versions of the definitions for the methods. 

**Maisie** 9% I wrote the initial query.py file.
